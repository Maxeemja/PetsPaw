PetsPaw - my internship task.
I am a newbie in front-end( became interested in this direction not so far ago) , so please - don't be very critical:)
Written on Vanilla JS and JQuery.
Unfortunately , I tried hard but had some problems with files uploading , so it may can't work properly.
You can turn on GitHub Pages with "gh-pages" branch and test my app. Thank you in advance.
